# What I look for in a CV

In my day job I see lots of CVs and most of them are, frankly, terrible. Some of them are probably OK for applying to companies you don't want to work at, like banks, but if you want to work in a small startup-like company with crazy-smart people then you need to rethink a lot of what you've got on there. Note that I'm not necessarily including myself in the crazy-smart category, but I'm doing my best to make sure everybody who works for me is; managing people is easy if they're better than you!

So, if you want to get through the door, this is what you need to do.

Firstly, and most importantly, I want to see prominent links to your GitHub profile, your Stack Overflow profile, your blog, your twitter feed, online courses you've completed, the website you made for your cat, etc., etc. In other words, convince me that development isn't just a job for you, that it's a passion, and something you'd do even if you didn't get paid for it. Because if it isn't, you're never going to be great. Sorry, but you're not. And that's fine; not everybody needs to be great. There are plenty of jobs for people who aren't great. They're just not at _my_ company.

Of course, these things aren't just useful for showing you've got passion. They're useful for showing that you can write code. We use [Codility](http://codility.com) to administer coding tests for people who haven't got enough of a public profile to convince us that they're able to write code. These are kinda fun -- I actually try the questions out in my spare time to challenge myself and see if there are new questions I'd like to use -- but they're a massively flawed way to see whether you're actually a good developer. You might come across a question that doesn't suit you, or one that you just can't see a solution to... or you might just have a bad day and do badly. Why take the risk? Show me code or forum answers or anything that proves you're awesome and we can skip past all that crap and start talking straight away.

The next thing I want to see is a bit of a personal profile. It doesn't have to be long -- a few sentences is enough -- but it should give me an insight into who you are, what you're looking for in a job, and what you're _not_ looking for in a job. Tell me what languages and platforms you like, and maybe even a short note about why. Tell me what languages and platforms you _don't_ like and why; often that's even more interesting than the positive stuff! Make me want to hire you as a person before I even start looking at your GitHub/SO/etc. profiles (note: at this point I've given you plus points for the links being there, but I probably haven't checked them out yet; make me want to do so!).

An important point when writing your personal profile is not to use any bullshit words (or "[wank words](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/ten-tips-for-slightly-less-awful-resume.html)" as Steve Yegge likes to call them) like "motivated self-starter", "enthusiastic", "experienced". Everybody puts that crap on there so you're just wasting space. Also, don't put things on there like "loves learning new technologies" unless you really do love learning new technologies and you can back it up with other things on your CV (e.g. you've introduced them at work, you're put a project using them up on GitHub, you've blogged about them) otherwise I'll just assume you've put this down because you think it's something you _should_ have done when you were actually slumped in front of the TV.

If you haven't got any links to your profiles on the web, and you haven't got a personal profile on the CV, then I'll probably stop reading at about that point. In many cases, that means I'll have got about as far as your name at the top before I stop caring.

Next!

However, if you've made it past that point then I'm probably already getting interested enough to think about setting up a chat, either on the phone or in person, so pretty much all you've got to do is not screw it up in the rest of the CV. As such, here are the things that you shouldn't do.

First, don't have a skills section listing every single technology you've ever heard of. In fact, don't even have a skills section at all. If it isn't important enough to highlight in your personal profile, then it isn't important enough to highlight full stop. The right place for any non-key technical skills is in your employment history which lets me see the context in which they were used. Long lists of technologies might be good for keyword-matching algorithms, but they just make me think you're spamming your CV out to lots of companies rather than being selective about your next role, which is hardly indicative of a great developer.

However, if you _really_ insist on having a skills section, then here's a list of things not to put in it:

- _JSE, JEE, Java ME, JMX, JAX-WS, JAX-RS, JMS, JDBC, JPA, JUnit, TestNG, Spring, Hibernate_: If you've done more than a couple of years of Java then it's fairly safe to assume that you've used most or all of the above. It's not something that makes you stand out. _Everybody_ who has done more than a couple of years of Java has done all of those things. The fact that you think you need to call it out as an achievement just makes you look like an idiot.
- _HTML5, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX_: These are now so ubiqitous that I tend to ignore them, because you probably don't know any of this stuff well enough to justify it being there. Having once made a page with Bootstrap and six lines of jQuery doesn't count. If you can't explain the differences between HTML 4 and 5, the box model, and hoisting and prototypal inheritance without even flinching then you don't know this stuff. Just take it off.
- _XML, XSLT, JSON, SQL, UML, etc._: You're a developer. I assume you know this stuff well enough to get by. You don't need to call it out specifically. OK, if you're unbelievably amazing at SQL then it might be worth calling out, but what you probably mean is that you know how to create, update and delete stuff which is hardly mind blowing.
- _SVN, Perforce, CVS, Git_: Wow! You can use source control systems! Who would have thought any developer in the modern age would be able to do something like that?! If you're Linus Torvalds and you actually _wrote_ Git then by all means put it on there, otherwise it's yet another thing I assume you're comfortable with.
- _Eclipse, IntelliJ Idea, XCode, Visual Studio, Flex Builder_: Seriously? You're telling me that you used IDEs to write code? I honestly cannot imagine what goes through the mind of anybody who thinks that listing the IDEs they've used on their CV is going to be in any way beneficial to their chances of getting a job.
- _Windows, UNIX, Linux, OS X_: Now you're just taking the piss.

## TODO: Employment history tips!

Oh yeah, I nearly forgot, because it's so obvious that I shouldn't even have to mention it. The fact that I do is something of a tragedy:

The acceptable number of spelling mistakes on a CV is zero.

The acceptable number of grammatical errors on a CV is zero.

The acceptable number of incorrectly capitalised acronyms on a CV is zero.

If your first language isn't English, the rest of your CV is brilliant, and I'm in a good mood then I _might_ make a concession and allow one mistake in one of these errors. But I probably won't. Development requires precision, and if you can't even get the couple of pages you're using to try and shape the next few years of your life right, then how can I trust you with code?

If your English isn't brilliant then get somebody to check your CV over before you submit it. Even a word processor will do a better job than most people manage; those red and green squiggly lines under words aren't just there for decoration. You should also consider going to evening classes or starting to write a blog to improve your skills. Communication - particularly written communication - is critical if you want to be able to influence people, so you need to get better at it.

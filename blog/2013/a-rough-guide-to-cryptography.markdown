# A rough guide to cryptography

Cryptography is perceived as an extremely complex subject, which is probably because when you get down to the theory of it, it _is_ pretty complex. It doesn't help that most basic guides to cryptography tend to focus on the theory without really explaining the practical applications of it - and there are a lot of practical applications. 

This is my attempt to outline the basics of cryptography in a practical and developer-centric way, with some real world scenarios thrown in to illustrate, and by the end you'll hopefully be able to recognise when cryptography can make difficult problems easy to solve.

## MACs



## Symmetric Encryption



## Signatures



## Asymmetric Encryption

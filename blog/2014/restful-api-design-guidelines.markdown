# RESTful API design guidelines

A new post over on the [blinkbox Books tech blog](https://blinkboxbooks.github.io/2014/11/18/restful-api-design-guidelines.html).

> We spend a lot of time designing RESTful APIs and discussing different patterns and paradigms. Contrary to popular opinion designing RESTful APIs is actually pretty difficult, so I thought I’d share some of the decisions we’ve made. You might not agree with everything, but I’ve included some discussion around the points so you can at least see why we think it’s the right thing to do...

You could consider it a more practical companion to my earlier [RESTful API Design: The Fundamentals](/blog/restful-api-design-the-fundamentals) post, focused on implementation rather than theory, and using real-world examples to illustrate situations.

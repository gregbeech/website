%h2 About Me
%p
  :kramdown
    My name is Greg Beech. I'm the Head of Core Platform Development for Books at blinkbox, working on the soon-to-be-launched eBook service from Tesco. Before that I spent 5 years or so working as a dev lead at [blinkbox](http://www.blinkbox.com/) on a variety of things including the core platform, video encoding, web APIs and client libraries.

    As I don't get to write a lot of code at work any more, in my free time I like to hack around and learn bits of different languages. The most recent of these is Ruby which I found quite captivating and used for a rewrite of this site.

    Occasionally I even do non-geeky things. I'm a keen biker and member of the IAM, and can often be found out on my ZZR1400 if the weather's nice (yeah, yeah, I'm a fair weather rider) with my girlfriend on the back. I also try my hand at boxing - not that you'd know it as I manage to balance any potential weight loss by eating too much.

    You can mail me using my first name @gregbeech.com. Recruiters please note that I'm not looking for a job and I won't give you information about anybody I work with, so contacting me about these things is a waste of both our time.

    If you already know me, you can add me on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/gregbeech) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gregbeech). You can also follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gregbeech).

%h2 About this Site
%p 
  :kramdown
    This site was written in a couple of days, partly as a project to learn some Ruby, and partly because I couldn't find any software that I was happy with which let me write blog posts in Markdown. It's hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), and the (very basic) code is [available on Github](https://github.com/gregbeech/website). Feel free to send me a pull request if you want to improve it!
